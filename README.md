# Chaos Game Fractal

Jupyter notebooks written in Python that demonstrate properties of fractals.

The `fractal_from_random` notebook creates fractals using the "Chaos Game". The idea for this repo came from [Brady Haran](http://www.bradyharan.com/)'s [Numberphile video on the subject](https://youtu.be/kbKtFN71Lfs). The `fractal_mandlebrot_julia` notebook was created for teaching purposes for [SMU](http://www.physics.smu.edu/web/)'s Honors Physics course, [PHYS 1010](http://www.physics.smu.edu/egodat/honors/)
